- Figure out how to respond to mousedown and dragging (update selection) in giu
- How to make scrollbars in Giu?
  I don't want to load the entire file so they have to work programmatically
- Add a (working) menu
- Add a toolbar
- How to do dynamic loading in Go? I.e. a standard plugin system would load a dll, then
  the dll could register itself with the program in the 'init' function.
  there is the 'plugin' package in the standard library. Problem solved. (doesn't work on windows)
- Figure out how to handle keys *properly* (i.e. does widget have focus or something)
- Calculating the characters/bytes per line is off by a factor 2, but i don't find any bugs.
  Maybe there is something wrong with my assumptions about calctextsize or the imgui theme padding?
- Opening the menu makes the tab-widget behave weird (i.e. it loses the current focussed tab and just opens the first)
  1) This is a bug in the giu library (the examples have the same behaviour)
     ... Open a bug report
  2) Find a work around for this issue
